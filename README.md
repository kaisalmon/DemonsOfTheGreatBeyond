A complete **deck-building roguelike card game** developed for the PICO-8 fantasy console. Built from scratch in **2025**, this project demonstrates game development within extreme technical constraints while implementing complex game mechanics and AI systems.

*PICO-8 is a "fantasy console" - a modern platform that emulates the limitations of 1980s hardware (128x128 resolution, 16 colors, 32KB cartridge size) to encourage creative problem-solving and efficient programming.*

## üîß Technical Overview

**Platform Constraints:**
- **128x128 pixel resolution** - All UI, animations, and visual feedback compressed into minimal space
- **16-color palette** - Complete visual design using extremely limited color options  
- **32KB code limit** - Entire game logic, data structures, and assets within severe memory constraints
- **Lua scripting** - All game systems implemented in Lua with performance optimization requirements

**Core Systems Implemented:**
- **Deck-building mechanics** - Dynamic card collection and deck management systems
- **Roguelike progression** - Procedural encounters, permadeath, and meta-progression
- **Strategic combat AI** - Enemy behavior trees and decision-making algorithms
- **State management** - Complex game state persistence within memory limitations
- **Procedural generation** - Random encounter and card reward systems

## üìã Development Notes

This project demonstrates **constrained programming** - solving complex software problems within artificial limitations that encourage creative solutions. Key skills applied:

- **Resource-constrained development** - Building feature-rich software within strict technical limits
- **Performance optimization** - Maximizing functionality while maintaining responsiveness  
- **Algorithm design** - Efficient implementations of complex game mechanics
- **User experience** - Creating engaging interfaces despite severe display limitations
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Ensuring consistent experience across different environments

PICO-8 development requires understanding both modern software engineering principles and retro hardware constraints, combining contemporary game design with old-school optimization techniques.
